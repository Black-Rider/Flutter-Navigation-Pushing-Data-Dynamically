A  Flutter application.
That explains how does the Navigation works in Flutter
Keeping in mind that navigator in flutter uses stack so pages are stacked upon each.
Navigator uses push function in order to push a page
Navigator also has a pop function which get You Back to the Home Page.
In this particular setup I have used to demonstrate how to send data dynamically using Map a generic data type.
Map is a generic data type and can hold multiple keys and their values.


Pages Attached are From Pages folder and lib
Pubsec. Yaml is not attached.
this is simple design that I have used one can create very interactive design.
